# IMDBData
The goal of this project is to apply a variety of data preprocessing tasks to a series of datasets. For the purposes of this report, we have considered three IMDB Movie datasets, two sourced from the Relational Dataset Repository- https://relational.fit.cvut.cz/dataset/IMDb and another sourced from Kaggle - https://www.kaggle.com/PromptCloudHQ/imdb-data
